#### <a href="#uri" name="uri" class="anchor"> URI </a>

URI's are transferred as strings. The URI's format is defined in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)

```
  foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
  \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
   |           |            |            |        |
scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
   |   _____________________|__
  / \ /                        \
  urn:example:animal:ferret:nose
```

We also maintain a node module to parse a string into `scheme`, `authority`, `path`, `query`, and `fragment` URI components. The GitHub repository is [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri) the npm module is [https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri).

Many of the interfaces contain fields that correspond to the URI of a document. For clarity, the type of such a field is declared as a `DocumentUri`. Over the wire, it will still be transferred as a string, but this guarantees that the contents of that string can be parsed as a valid URI.

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#documentUri" name="documentUri" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
type DocumentUri = string;
```

There is also a tagging interface for normal non document URIs. It maps to a `string` as well.

```typescript
type URI = string;
```

Please note that a URI with a scheme of `file` represents a file that is written on disk. Documents that exist in the editor but are not written on disk, sometimes called untitled or scratch files, must used a different scheme which can be decided by the client. If a document is deleted on disk but still present in the editor, the URI may retain the scheme of `file` as some editors allow the user to save the document on disk using the same name.
